# SAP Concur Web Services - Authentication

## Description
This collection provides the basic example of Web Service authentication that is most commonly used by SAP Concur customers (versus partners).  There are two files included in this repository:

1) Concur Default Env.postman_environment.json - this environment contains the necessary variables needed in the Authentication JSON.  This allows for multiple applications to use/reuse the Authentication collection
2) Authentication.postman_collection.json - this collection demonstrates the authentication APIs
